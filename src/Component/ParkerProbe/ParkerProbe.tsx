The Parker Solar Probe is a groundbreaking NASA mission designed to explore the Sun's outer atmosphere and unlock some of the mysteries of our closest star. Named after Dr. Eugene Parker, a pioneering astrophysicist who first proposed the existence of the solar wind in the 1950s, the spacecraft has already provided valuable insights into the Sun's behavior.
